== Kalenderwochen

Meaning calendar weeks. In some industries it is quiet common to set goals
or deadlines in terms of calendar weeks. It doesn't matter which day this week.
What matters: during this specific week.

My tax assistant or any other office guy tries to make an appointment with me by
just giving me the calendar week. WTF? If you're a freelancer like me or any other
person which is not familiar with the concept of calendar week, you're screwed sometimes.

That's why i wrote this tiny rails app, anybody can deploy to a server and
subscibe to the calendar with the following url

   webcal://your.server.com/
   
Your Outlook or iCal pops open and you'll have it directly available in your favourite
calendar application. That's it.
