# = New Relic Agent
#
# New Relic RPM is a performance monitoring application for Ruby
# applications running in production.  For more information on RPM
# please visit http://www.newrelic.com.
#
# The New Relic Agent can be installed in Ruby applications to gather
# runtime performance metrics, traces, and errors for display in a
# Developer Mode UI (mapped to /newrelic in your application server)
# or for monitoring and analysis at http://rpm.newrelic.com.
#
# For detailed information on configuring or customizing the RPM Agent
# please visit our {support and documentation site}[http://support.newrelic.com].
#
# == Starting the Agent as a Gem
#
# For Rails, add:
#    config.gem 'newrelic_rpm'
# to your initialization sequence.
#
# For merb, do 
#    dependency 'newrelic_rpm'
# in the Merb config/init.rb
#
# For other frameworks, or to manage the agent manually, 
# invoke NewRelic::Agent#manual_start directly.
#
# == Configuring the Agent
# 
# All agent configuration is done in the +newrelic.yml+ file.  This
# file is by default read from the +config+ directory of the
# application root and is subsequently searched for in the application
# root directory, and then in a +~/.newrelic+ directory
#
# == Agent APIs
#
# For adding custom instrumentation to method invocation, refer to 
# the docs in the class NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer.
#
# For information on how to instrument something other than Rails so
# that high level dispatcher actions or background tasks show up as first
# class operations in RPM, refer to NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation
# and NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation::ClassMethods.
#
# Methods in this module as well as MethodTracer and ControllerInstrumentation
# are available to applications.  When the
# agent is not enabled the method implementations are stubbed into
# no-ops to reduce overhead.
#
# Methods and classes in other parts of the agent are not guaranteed
# to be available between releases.
#
# Refer to the online docs at support.newrelic.com to see how to access
# the data collected by custom instrumentation, or e-mail support at New Relic
# for help.
